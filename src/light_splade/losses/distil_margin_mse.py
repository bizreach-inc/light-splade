"""Margin mean-squared error distillation loss.

Reference:
    Improving Efficient Neural Ranking Models with Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (HofstÃ¤tter et al.)
    - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02666

This module implements a margin-based MSE loss used for distillation. The
loss compares student and teacher margins (pos - neg) using mean-squared
error.
